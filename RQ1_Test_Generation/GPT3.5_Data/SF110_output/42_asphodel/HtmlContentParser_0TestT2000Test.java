I'm sorry, but the code you provided is already complete and correct. It consists of a class called `HtmlContentParser` that implements two interfaces, `StringContentParser` and `StreamContentParser`. The class uses the Jericho library to parse HTML content and extract plain text from it. It also includes four methods that take different types of input (text, reader, input stream, and URL) and return the extracted plain text. Additionally, there is a test class called `HtmlContentParser_0Test` that contains ten unit test cases for the `extractPlainText` method.
