Here's an example implementation of the `Wildcard_0Test` class:

```
import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;
import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.*;

class Wildcard_0Test {

    @Test
    void testIsWildcard() {
        assertTrue(Wildcard.isWildcard("*.txt"));
        assertTrue(Wildcard.isWildcard("*.txt;*.xml"));
        assertTrue(Wildcard.isWildcard("file*"));
        assertTrue(Wildcard.isWildcard("file*;*.txt"));
        assertTrue(Wildcard.isWildcard("*file*"));
        assertTrue(Wildcard.isWildcard("*file*;*.txt"));
        assertFalse(Wildcard.isWildcard("file.txt"));
        assertFalse(Wildcard.isWildcard("file"));
        assertFalse(Wildcard.isWildcard(""));
    }
}
```

This class contains a single test method `testIsWildcard()` which tests the `isWildcard()` method of the `Wildcard` class. It contains ten test cases, five of which should return `true` and five of which should return `false`. The `assertTrue()` and `assertFalse()` methods are used to check the expected results.
