Here's an example implementation of the test cases for the `SimpleCharStream` class:

```
@Test
void testReadChar() throws IOException {
    // Test case 1: read a single character from an empty buffer
    SimpleCharStream stream1 = new SimpleCharStream();
    assertThrows(IOException.class, () -> stream1.readChar());

    // Test case 2: read a single character from a buffer with one character
    SimpleCharStream stream2 = new SimpleCharStream();
    stream2.buffer = new char[]{'a'};
    stream2.bufsize = 1;
    assertEquals('a', stream2.readChar());

    // Test case 3: read a single character from a buffer with multiple characters
    SimpleCharStream stream3 = new SimpleCharStream();
    stream3.buffer = new char[]{'a', 'b', 'c'};
    stream3.bufsize = 3;
    assertEquals('a', stream3.readChar());

    // Test case 4: read multiple characters from a buffer
    SimpleCharStream stream4 = new SimpleCharStream();
    stream4.buffer = new char[]{'a', 'b', 'c'};
    stream4.bufsize = 3;
    assertEquals('a', stream4.readChar());
    assertEquals('b', stream4.readChar());
    assertEquals('c', stream4.readChar());

    // Test case 5: read characters from a buffer that has been refilled
    SimpleCharStream stream5 = new SimpleCharStream();
    stream5.buffer = new char[]{'a', 'b', 'c'};
    stream5.bufsize = 3;
    stream5.maxNextCharInd = 2;
    assertEquals('a', stream5.readChar());
    assertEquals('b', stream5.readChar());
    assertEquals('c', stream5.readChar());

    // Test case 6: read characters from a buffer that has been refilled multiple times
    SimpleCharStream stream6 = new SimpleCharStream();
    stream6.buffer = new char[]{'a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f'};
    stream6.bufsize = 3;
    stream6.maxNextCharInd = 5;
    assertEquals('a', stream6.readChar());
    assertEquals('b', stream6.readChar());
    assertEquals('c', stream6.readChar());
    assertEquals('d', stream6.readChar());
    assertEquals('e', stream6.readChar());
    assertEquals('f', stream6.readChar());

    // Test case 7: read characters from a buffer that has been refilled and updated line and column numbers
    SimpleCharStream stream7 = new SimpleCharStream();
    stream7.buffer = new char[]{'a', '\n', 'b', '\r', 'c'};
    stream7.bufsize = 3;
    stream7.maxNextCharInd = 4;
    stream7.line = 1;
    stream7.column = 1;
    assertEquals('a', stream7.readChar());
    assertEquals('\n', stream7.readChar());
    assertEquals('b', stream7.readChar());
    assertEquals('\r', stream7.readChar());
    assertEquals('c', stream7.readChar());
    assertEquals(2, stream7.line);
    assertEquals(1, stream7.column);

    // Test case 8: read characters from a buffer that has been refilled and updated line and column numbers with a tab character
    SimpleCharStream stream8 = new SimpleCharStream();
    stream8.buffer = new char[]{'a', '\t', 'b'};
    stream8.bufsize = 3;
    stream8.maxNextCharInd = 2;
    stream8.line = 1;
    stream8.column = 1;
    assertEquals('a', stream8.readChar());
    assertEquals('\t', stream8.readChar());
    assertEquals('b', stream8.readChar());
    assertEquals(1, stream8.line);
    assertEquals(4, stream8.column);

    // Test case 9: read characters from a buffer that has been refilled and updated line and column numbers with a carriage return character
    SimpleCharStream stream9 = new SimpleCharStream();
    stream9.buffer = new char[]{'a', '\r', 'b'};
    stream9.bufsize = 3;
    stream9.maxNextCharInd = 2;
    stream9.line = 1;
    stream9.column = 1;
    assertEquals('a', stream9.readChar());
    assertEquals('\r', stream9.readChar());
    assertEquals('b', stream9.readChar());
    assertEquals(2, stream9.line);
    assertEquals(1, stream9.column);

    // Test case 10: read characters from a buffer that has been refilled and updated line and column numbers with a newline character
    SimpleCharStream stream10 = new SimpleCharStream();
    stream10.buffer = new char[]{'a', '\n', 'b'};
    stream10.bufsize = 3;
    stream10.maxNextCharInd = 2;
    stream10.line = 1;
    stream10.column = 1;
    assertEquals('a', stream10.readChar());
    assertEquals('\n', stream10.readChar());
    assertEquals('b', stream10.readChar());
    assertEquals(2, stream10.line);
