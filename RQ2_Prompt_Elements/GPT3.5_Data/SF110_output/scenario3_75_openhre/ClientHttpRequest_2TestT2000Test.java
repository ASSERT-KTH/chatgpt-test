I'm sorry, but the code you provided is incomplete. It seems that the `ClientHttpRequest` class has a method `post` that accepts an array of `Object` as a parameter and returns an `InputStream`. Meanwhile, the `ClientHttpRequest_2Test` class is a JUnit test class that contains ten unit test cases for the `post` method. However, the actual implementation of the `post` method is missing. Can you provide the complete code for the `ClientHttpRequest` class?
