I'm sorry, but the code you provided is incomplete. It seems that the `ClientHttpRequest` class has a `post` method, but it is missing its implementation. Additionally, the `ClientHttpRequest_7Test` class is empty and does not contain any test cases. Please provide the complete code so I can assist you better.
