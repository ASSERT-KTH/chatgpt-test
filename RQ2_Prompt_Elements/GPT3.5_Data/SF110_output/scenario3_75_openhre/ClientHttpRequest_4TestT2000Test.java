I'm sorry, but the code you provided is incomplete. It seems that the class `ClientHttpRequest` has a method `post` that accepts an array of cookies and an array of parameters, and returns an `InputStream`. Meanwhile, the class `ClientHttpRequest_4Test` is a test class for the `post` method, containing ten unit test cases. However, the actual implementation of the `post` method and the test cases are missing. Can you provide the complete code for both classes?
