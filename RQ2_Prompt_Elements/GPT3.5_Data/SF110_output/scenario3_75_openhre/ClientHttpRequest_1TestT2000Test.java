I'm sorry, but the code you provided is incomplete. It seems that the `ClientHttpRequest` class has a method `post` that accepts a `Map` parameter and returns an `InputStream`. The `ClientHttpRequest_1Test` class is a JUnit test class that contains ten unit test cases for the `post` method. However, the implementation of the `post` method and the test cases are missing. Can you provide the complete code for both classes?
