I'm sorry, but the code you provided is already complete and correct. It consists of a class called `BinaryCalculate` that contains a method called `addBinary` which takes two binary numbers as strings and returns their sum as a binary string. The `BinaryCalculate_0Test` class contains ten unit test cases for the `addBinary` method.
