I'm sorry, but the code you provided is incomplete. The `DefaultNoteListModel` class has a method `firstElement()` that returns an `AbstractNote` object, but the method implementation is missing. Additionally, the `DefaultNoteListModel_9Test` class is missing the actual test cases for the `firstElement()` method. Can you please provide the complete code so I can assist you better?
