I'm sorry, but the code you provided is incomplete. The `DefaultNoteListModel` class has a method signature for `size()`, but there is no implementation for it. Additionally, the `DefaultNoteListModel_1Test` class is incomplete and does not contain any test cases. Please provide the complete code so I can assist you better.
