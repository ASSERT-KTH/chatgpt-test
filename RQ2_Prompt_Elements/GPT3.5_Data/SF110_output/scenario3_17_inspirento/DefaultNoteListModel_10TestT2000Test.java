I'm sorry, but the code you provided is incomplete. The `DefaultNoteListModel` class has a method `lastElement()` that returns an `AbstractNote` object, but the method implementation is missing. Also, the `DefaultNoteListModel_10Test` class is missing the actual test cases. Can you please provide the complete code so I can assist you better?
