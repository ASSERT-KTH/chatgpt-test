I'm sorry, but the code you provided is incomplete. It seems that the `loadPreference` method in `HttpPreference` is not properly implemented and lacks a return type. Additionally, the `HttpPreferenceTest` class is not properly closed with a closing brace. Could you please provide the complete and correct code so I can assist you better?
