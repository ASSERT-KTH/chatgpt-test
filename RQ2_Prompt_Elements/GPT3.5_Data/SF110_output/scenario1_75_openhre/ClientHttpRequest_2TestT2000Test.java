I'm sorry, but the code you provided is incomplete. It seems that the class `ClientHttpRequest` has a method `post` that accepts an array of `Object` as parameter and returns an `InputStream`. The class `ClientHttpRequest_2Test` is a JUnit test class that contains ten unit test cases for the `post` method. However, the actual implementation of the `post` method and the test cases are missing. Can you provide the complete code for both classes?
