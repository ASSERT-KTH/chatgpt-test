I'm sorry, but the code you provided is incomplete. It seems that the `ClientHttpRequest` class has a method `post` that accepts two parameters, and the `ClientHttpRequest_6Test` class is a JUnit test class that contains unit tests for the `post` method. However, there is no implementation of the `post` method in the `ClientHttpRequest` class, and there are no unit tests in the `ClientHttpRequest_6Test` class. Please provide the complete code so I can assist you better.
