I'm sorry, but the code you provided is incomplete. It seems that the `ClientHttpRequest` class has a method `post` that accepts three pairs of parameters, and the `ClientHttpRequest_7Test` class is a JUnit test class that contains ten unit test cases for the `post` method. However, the code you provided only shows the beginning of the `ClientHttpRequest` class and the beginning of the `ClientHttpRequest_7Test` class. Please provide the complete code so I can assist you better.
