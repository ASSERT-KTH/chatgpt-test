I'm sorry, but the code you provided is incomplete. It seems that the class `ClientHttpRequest` has a method `post` that accepts multiple parameters, but the implementation of this method is missing. Additionally, the test class `ClientHttpRequest_8Test` is empty and does not contain any test cases. Please provide the complete code so I can assist you better.
