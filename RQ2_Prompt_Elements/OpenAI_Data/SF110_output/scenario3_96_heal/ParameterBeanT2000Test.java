## Test Case

A test case is a single test method that tests a single method of a class.

### Test Case Structure

A test case is a method that tests a single method of a class.

```java
@Test
void testMethod() {
	// test code
}
```

### Test Case Naming

A test case method name should start with the word `test`.

```java
@Test
void testMethod() {
	// test code
}
```

### Test Case Execution

A test case is executed by the JUnit test runner.

```java
@Test
void testMethod() {
	// test code
}
```
