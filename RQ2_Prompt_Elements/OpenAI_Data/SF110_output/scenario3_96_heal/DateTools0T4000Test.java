## Test Driven Development

### Test Driven Development

* Test Driven Development (TDD) is a software development process that relies on the repetition of a very short development cycle: requirements are turned into very specific test cases, then the software is improved to pass the new tests, only. This is opposed to software development that allows software to be added that is not proven to meet requirements.

### Test Driven Development Cycle

* The TDD cycle is:
	* Add a test
	* Run all tests and see if the new one fails
	* Write some code
	* Run tests
	* Refactor code
	* Repeat

### Test Driven Development Benefits

* TDD has many benefits:
	* It makes you think about the design before you write the code.
	* It makes you write the tests first, which means you are forced to think about the API before you write the code.
	* It makes you write the minimal amount of code to pass the test.
	* It makes you think about edge cases.
	* It makes you think about error conditions.
	* It makes you think about performance.
	* It makes you think about security.
	* It makes you think about usability.
	* It makes you think about internationalization.
	* It makes you think about accessibility.
	* It makes you think about maintainability.
	* It makes you think about testability.
	* It makes you think about portability.
	* It makes you think about reusability.
